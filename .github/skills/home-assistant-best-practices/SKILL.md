  Best practices for HA automations, helpers, scripts, device controls, and dashboards.

  TRIGGER THIS SKILL WHEN:
  - Creating/editing automations, scripts, scenes, or dashboards
  - Choosing between template sensors and built-in helpers
  - Writing or restructuring triggers, conditions, or automation modes
  - Setting up Zigbee button/remote automations (ZHA or Zigbee2MQTT)
  - Renaming entities or migrating device_id to entity_id
  - Configuring dashboard cards or picking helpers to feed them
  - Looking up card types or domain-specific documentation

  SYMPTOMS:
  - Agent uses Jinja2 templates where native conditions/triggers/helpers exist
  - Agent uses device_id instead of entity_id
  - Agent modifies entity IDs without checking consumers
  - Agent chooses wrong automation mode (e.g., single for motion lights)
  - Agent hard-codes values or picks raw sensor over derived helper
  - Agent searches for HA config files on disk or generates YAML snippets
  - Agent tells user to edit configuration.yaml for UI-configured integrations

# Home Assistant Best Practices

**Core principle:** Use native Home Assistant constructs wherever possible. Templates bypass validation, fail silently at runtime, and make debugging opaque.

## Decision Workflow

Follow this sequence when creating any automation:

### 0. Gate: modifying existing config?

If your change affects entity IDs or cross-component references — renaming entities, replacing template sensors with helpers, converting device triggers, or restructuring automations — read `references/safe-refactoring.md` first. That reference covers impact analysis, device-sibling discovery, and post-change verification. Complete its workflow before proceeding.

Steps 1-5 below apply to new config or pattern evaluation.

### 1. Check for native condition/trigger
Before writing any template, check `references/automation-patterns.md` for native alternatives.

**Common substitutions:**
- `{{ states('x') | float > 25 }}` → `numeric_state` condition with `above: 25`
- `{{ is_state('x', 'on') and is_state('y', 'on') }}` → `condition: and` with state conditions
- `{{ now().hour >= 9 }}` → `condition: time` with `after: "09:00:00"`
- `wait_template: "{{ is_state(...) }}"` → `wait_for_trigger` with state trigger (caveat: different behavior when state is already true — see `references/safe-refactoring.md#trigger-restructuring`)

### 2. Check for built-in helper or Template Helper
Before creating a template sensor, check `references/helper-selection.md`.

**Common substitutions:**
- Sum/average multiple sensors → `min_max` integration
- Binary any-on/all-on logic → `group` helper
- Rate of change → `derivative` integration
- Cross threshold detection → `threshold` integration
- Consumption tracking → `utility_meter` helper

**If no built-in helper fits, use a Template Helper — not YAML.**
Create it via the HA config flow (MCP tool or API) or via the UI:
Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers → Create Helper → Template.
Only write `template:` YAML if explicitly requested or if neither path is available.

### 3. Select correct automation mode
Default `single` mode is often wrong. See `references/automation-patterns.md#automation-modes`.

| Scenario | Mode |
|----------|------|
| Motion light with timeout | `restart` |
| Sequential processing (door locks) | `queued` |
| Independent per-entity actions | `parallel` |
| One-shot notifications | `single` |

### 4. Use entity_id over device_id
`device_id` breaks when devices are re-added. See `references/device-control.md`.

**Exception:** Zigbee2MQTT autodiscovered device triggers are acceptable.

### 5. For Zigbee buttons/remotes
- **ZHA:** Use `event` trigger with `device_ieee` (persistent)
- **Z2M:** Use `device` trigger (autodiscovered) or `mqtt` trigger

See `references/device-control.md#zigbee-buttonremote-patterns`.

## Critical Anti-Patterns

| Anti-pattern | Use instead | Why | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| `condition: template` with `float > 25` | `condition: numeric_state` | Validated at load, not runtime | `references/automation-patterns.md#native-conditions` |
| `wait_template: "{{ is_state(...) }}"` | `wait_for_trigger` with state trigger | Event-driven, not polling; waits for *change* (see `references/safe-refactoring.md#trigger-restructuring` for semantic differences) | `references/automation-patterns.md#wait-actions` |
| `device_id` in triggers | `entity_id` (or `device_ieee` for ZHA) | device_id breaks on re-add | `references/device-control.md#entity-id-vs-device-id` |
| `mode: single` for motion lights | `mode: restart` | Re-triggers must reset the timer | `references/automation-patterns.md#automation-modes` |
| `enabled: false` as a top-level key in `automations.yaml` | `automation.turn_off` (temporary) or entity registry disable (permanent) | Not a valid top-level key — rejected during schema validation; automation loads as `unavailable` | `references/automation-patterns.md#disabling-automations` |
| Template sensor for sum/mean | `min_max` helper | Declarative, handles unavailable states | `references/helper-selection.md#numeric-aggregation` |
| Template binary sensor with threshold | `threshold` helper | Built-in hysteresis support | `references/helper-selection.md#threshold` |
| Renaming entity IDs without impact analysis | Follow `references/safe-refactoring.md` workflow | Renames break dashboards, scripts, scenes, Config-Entry data, and storage dashboards silently | `references/safe-refactoring.md#entity-renames` |
| Renaming members of Config-Entry-based groups (UI groups) without updating membership | Update group membership via Options Flow after the registry rename | The entity registry rename does not update `options.entities` in the Config Entry — group silently breaks | `references/safe-refactoring.md#config-entry-groups` |
| Renaming entities used by Config-Entry integrations (Better/Generic Thermostat, Min/Max, Threshold) without patching Config-Entry data | Scan and patch `core.config_entries` `data`+`options` fields | These integrations store entity_ids in Config Entry — not updated by entity registry renames | `references/safe-refactoring.md#config-entry-data--blind-spots-for-entity-registry-renames` |
| `template:` sensor/binary sensor in YAML | Template Helper (UI or config flow API) | Requires file edit and config reload; harder to manage | `references/template-guidelines.md` |
| Searching for or reading HA config files on disk | Use the HA REST/WebSocket API to manage config programmatically | HA is a remote system accessed via APIs; config files are not on the local filesystem | — |
| Generating YAML snippets for automations/scripts/scenes | Use the HA config API to create automations/scripts programmatically | API calls validate config, avoid syntax errors, and don't require manual file edits or restarts | `references/automation-patterns.md`, `references/examples.yaml` |
| Telling user to edit `configuration.yaml` for integrations | Direct user to Settings > Devices & Services in the HA UI | Most integrations are UI-configured; YAML integration config is rare and integration-specific | — |
| Referring to HA "add-ons" | Use the term "Apps" | HA renamed add-ons to Apps in 2026.2 — "Apps are standalone applications that run alongside Home Assistant" | — |
| `vacuum.send_command` with vendor room IDs | `vacuum.clean_area` with HA `area_id` (if segments are mapped) | Uses native HA areas, works across integrations — but requires segment-to-area mapping in entity settings first | `references/device-control.md#vacuum-control` |
| Using `color_temp` (mireds) in light service calls | Use `color_temp_kelvin` | The `color_temp` parameter was removed in 2026.3; only Kelvin is supported | `references/device-control.md#lights` |
